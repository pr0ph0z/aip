                    "The official website for Shueisha's Jump j Books imprint revealed on Friday that Koyoharu Gotouge's Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba manga is inspiring a second novel on October 4.

Hirano also launched the four-panel spinoff manga Kimetsu no Aima! on Shueisha's Shonen Jump+ app and website in April.",

                    "Firefighter-themed shōnen anime Fire Force has delayed and edited its episodes in response to an arson attack committed last Thursday at Kyoto Animation Studios that ranks as one of Japanese's deadliest mass-murders since the end of WWII.\n\nFire Force revolves around a heroic supernatural fire brigade who combat mysterious demons called Infernals. These skeletal demons are born when a regular human spontaneously combusts into a ball of flame.\n\nThe series is animated at David Production, and it is easy to see how an anime regularly portraying death by fire is insensitive in light of the arson attack at an anime studio. According to a statement by the MBS channel, where Fire Force airs, the anime's forthcoming third episode has been delayed until July 26. In addition, the color of fire has been changed, presumably to a more unnatural, magical hue.\n\nThe channel didn't comment on whether further episodes of the anime will retain the color change, but did say that “from episode 4 onward, we will deal [with similar situations] accordingly.”\n\nThe fire at Kyoto Animation, the creators of beloved shows like Clannad , The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Free, claimed the lives of 34 people and left dozens more injured.",

While the outsiders were brought to our protagonists' village thanks in part to an escaped slave, a battle was about to break loose thanks in part to a personal grudge. The grudge itself was stopped by the slave's master, who wraps his chain around the face of the instigator, and pulling the chain back, ends the conflict in the most horrific way possible.\n\nWith the chain returned, so to does bits of hair and skin return with it.\n\nThis gut wrenching scene goes to show how serious Vinland Saga can be, and while there have only been three episodes released onto Amazon Prime so far, the franchise is definitely worth your time so far.\n\nOriginally created by Makoto Yukimura for Kodansha's Weekly Shonen Magazine, before being moved to Afternoon, in 2005, Vinland Saga has been collected into 21 volumes and has more than five million copies in print as of 2018. The series features a dramatization of King Cnut the Great's rise to power in English at the start of the 11th century.",

Enter Senku and Taiju, two high school best friends who attempt to use their brains and their brawns to bring things back to the modern day after being frozen in stone for thousands of years. Finding themselves freed from their prisons thanks to a bit of luck and a mysterious fluid, the pair attempts to free not only their friends, but the world at large from their fates.\n\nNow, for those interested in performing some of Senku's experiments, a book of “Do It Yourself” is coming with that in mind!\n\nAs mentioned earlier, these experiments will be fairly safe, including teaching readers how to make a telescope out of a magnifying glass, how to make balloons out of garbage bags and many other things.\n\nThe experiments that take place in the Dr. Stone series proper are pretty dangerous when all is said and done, with one of the most recent efforts being creating gun powder. Obviously we don't think that the latter will be making its way into a “DIY” book any time soon.",
